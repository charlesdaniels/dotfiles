# This tool consumes input on standard in, then converts it to tab-separated
# values using ``awk``. Fields are divided according to the default ``awk``
# field separator. For example, the input ``a b  c`` would be converted to ``a
# b	c``. This is useful when dealing with tools such as ``ps`` which try to
# produce human-readable tables.
