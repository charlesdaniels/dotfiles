# .SCRIPTDOC

# This script is used to hook other scripts that need to run under various
# conditions, and which I have not found better hooks for. This is highly
# specific to my setup, and probably will be of minimal use to anyone else.

# This script runs a loop every $DESKTOP_SPOOLER_INTERVAL. When this loop runs,
# it polls lsusb to see if $DOCK_DEVICE exists, using this information to
# populate $DOCK_STATE. If $DOCK_STATE changes, the script restore-sanity is
# executed, and the file $DOCK_SPOOLER_DIR/dock_status is updated.

# .ENDOC
