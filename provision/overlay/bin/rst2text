# This script reads reStructuredText from standard input, converts it to plain
# text, and sends that to standard output. This is useful for viewing
# reStructuredText documents which are machine-generated and may have lots of
# embedded commands or odd formatting.

# This script requires rst2html to convert the reStructuredText to HTML, and
# links2 to render it to text.
