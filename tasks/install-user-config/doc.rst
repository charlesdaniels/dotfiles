Overview
========

This is the closest thing this repository has to something that would be
understood in the contemporary computing vernacular of "installs the dotfiles".
This task installs all dotfiles and other user-account-specific configuration
which does not require root access or modify the set of applications installed
system-wide. This task does nothing in of itself, and just depends on lots of
other tasks which do the real work.
