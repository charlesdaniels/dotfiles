# .SCRIPTDOC

# Lock the screen using i3lock. The i3lock background is set to a screenshot
# of the screen at the time the script is run, blurred via an 8x8 filter.

# Note that the dpms settings are re-configured automatically each time this
# script is run.

# Note also that this script checks to see if i3lock is already running, and if
# so exits silentl, doing nothing.

# This script can safely be run as root; it will detect the logged in user who
# is running a process named ``i3``, and run ``i3lock`` as this user.
