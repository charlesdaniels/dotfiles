Overview
========

Install ``pacaur`` via ``pacman``. Note that this assumes that ``pacaur`` is
in a repository it can be installed from. On Antergos based installations of
ArchLinux, this is usually a safe assumption.

    ``pacaur`` is no longer the vouge tool for AUR management, a more up to
    date tool should be selected instead.

.. todo::

    It is not a safe assumption to assume that ``pacaur`` will be install-able
    from ``pacman`` directly. This task should either ensure that the Antergos
    repo is added to the list of repos, or perform the "manual" AUR based
    installation of ``pacaur`` or whatever tool is selected in lieu thereof.
