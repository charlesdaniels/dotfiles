# Generate a wallpaper using burnwallpaper from ~/.wallpapers/current and store
# it in ~/.wallpapers/burned. Then, for every monitor which is in a horizontal
# configuration according to xrandr, set ~/.wallpapers/burned as the
# background, and set ~/.wallpapers/vertical for any monitors which are in a
# vertical orientation.
