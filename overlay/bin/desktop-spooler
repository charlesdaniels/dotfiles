# .SCRIPTDOC

# This script is used to hook other scripts that need to run under various
# conditions, and which I have not found better hooks for. This is highly
# specific to my setup, and probably will be of minimal use to anyone else.

# This script runs a loop every $DESKTOP_SPOOLER_INTERVAL. When this loop runs,
# it polls lsusb to see if any of the USB device IDs specified in
# ~/.dspool/dock_devices.txt exist, using this information to populate
# $DOCK_STATE. If $DOCK_STATE changes, the script restore-sanity is executed,
# and the file $DOCK_SPOOLER_DIR/dock_status is updated.
