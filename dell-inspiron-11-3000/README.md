# Introduction
This folder contains documentation and config files relating to the dell Inspiron 11-3000 2-in-1 laptop computer, including model-specific configs. 

This particular system is quite sane, and most things work as they should (eg. media keys generated appropriate XF86 codes). These config files are related specifically to Antergos (Archlinux), and may not work without modification on other systems.
