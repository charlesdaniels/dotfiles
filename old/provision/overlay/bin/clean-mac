# Accepts one or more MAC addresses on standard input, formats them to be
# lower case and colon-delimited. Characters which are not valid hexadecimal
# characters will be discarded. Each converted input is displayed on it's own
# line on standard out. Error checking is not done - if you put invalid MACs
# in, you will get invalid MACs back out.
