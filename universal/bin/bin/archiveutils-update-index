#  OVERVIEW
#  ========
#  
#  Populate the archive index in $NET_CDANIELS_CACHE_DIR from the
#  /Archive/Tools directory on $NET_CDANIELS_ARCHIVEUTILS_SERVER_WAN and/or
#  NET_CDANIELS_ARCHIVEUTILS_SERVER_LAN.
#  
#  Tests for connection first to the LAN server, then to the WAN server. If
#  the LAN server is reachable, it will be used to populate the archive,
#  otherwise the WAN server will be used. The LAN server is specified in the
#  git-controlled config for this script, however for security, the WAN server
#  is kept in the system-specific config file, as it is globally route-able.
#  
#  This script uses SCP to fetch files and from the servers, and SSH to run
#  remote commands.
