#
#  OVERVIEW
#  ========
#  This script serves to invoke Sublime Text from the macOS commandline. This
#  is useful, as OSX normally does not make it very easy to open .apps from
#  the shell.
#  
#  Note that because of weirdness in osascript, only $1 is passed into
#  osascript. This means globbing probably won't work. For more info, start
#  here:

#  
#  USAGE
#  =====
#  
#    $1 . . . . the file/folder to open
#
########10########20########30# CONFIGURATION  #50########60########70########80
SUBL_APP_NAME="Sublime Text"
TARGET_PATH=$(echo "$1" | tr "/" ":")
SCRIPT="Tell Application \"$SUBL_APP_NAME\" to open \"$TARGET_PATH\""
