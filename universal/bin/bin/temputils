#
#  OVERVIEW
#  ========
#  Utilities used to work with temporary directories. This is intended to be
#  used only by other scripts, as it will probably not be particularly useful
#  for an end user. 
#  
#  USAGE
#  =====
#  
#   $1 . . . . Application tag - used to separate different application's temp
#              dirs
#   
#   $2 . . . . Action - one of several operations enumerated below
#   
#  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
#  =====================
#  
#   TEMPUTILS_PREFIX_DIR . . . if set, will be used as the parent for all
#                              temputils created directories, otherwise
#                              defaults to `/tmp/`
#  
#  ACTIONS
#  =======
#  
#  create
#    create a temp folder in `/tmp` named by application tag
#    
#  destroy
#    remove a temp folder in `/tmp` named by application tag
#    
#  get 
#    display on stdout the full path of the temporary folder for the
#    application tag
