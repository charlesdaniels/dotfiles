#  OVERVIEW
#  ========
#  This script identifies an appropriate package manager and invokes it to
#  perform an installation on ``$@``. Normally, this means all arguments are
#  packages which are to be installed via the package manager. Note however
#  that you may pass additional arguments to the underlying package manage by
#  passing them to ``pkg-install``.
#  
#  USAGE
#  =====
#   $@ . . . passed through to underlying package manager, preceded by an
#            appropriate, package manager specific install directive.
