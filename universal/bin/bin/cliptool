#  OVERVIEW
#  ========
#  Tool for interacting with clipboards on various platforms. Currently,
#  support is implemented, although not fully tested for pbcopy (OSX), xsel
#  and xclip (generic UNIX), and copyQ (cross platform).
#  
#  Because it supports the most common and popular clipboard managers
#  available, this tool should work correctly on most UNIX systems. At the
#  very least, it should work on an macOS system, as pbcopy/pbpaste are OS
#  components for Mac. Most Linux systems will come with either xsel or xclip.
#  
#  USAGE
#  =====
#  
#   $1 . . . . if `copy` - copy standard input to the system clipboard
#              if `get`  - output the system clipboard contents to stdout
#              
#  CLIPBOARD MANAGER PRIORITY
#  ==========================
#  The clipboard manager which is used is selected by testing for the presence
#  of a given binary in $PATH. If multiple clipboard managers are present, one
#  will be chosen base on the following order:
#  
#  * copyQ
#  * pbcopy/pbpaste
#  * xsel
#  * xclip
#  
#  EVIRONMENT VARIABLES
#  ====================
#  CLIPTOOL_CLIPBOARD_MANAGER . . . if set, the specified clipboard manager
#                                   will be used instead of following the
#                                   above hierarchy. Note that the specified
#                                   clipboard manager must be one of the
#                                   supported ones, or the program will crash.
#
