#
#  OVERVIEW
#  ========
#  
#  Detects an appropriate OCR software on the system and attempts to OCR the
#  given PDF and burn-in  the detected text.
#  
#  SUPPORTED OCR SOFTWARE
#  ======================
#  
#  * PDFPen Pro (6.2.1+)
#  
#  FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
#  ==================
#  
#  * it would be cool for Linux/BSD systems if adobe acrobat could be used
#    from the commandline, as acrobat 8 runs fairly well via WINE.
#  
#  * tessearct support would be neat, but I'm not sure how to get it to "burn
#    in" text.
#    
#  * should add support for PDFPen, in addition to PDFPen pro, should just be
#    an extra check, as invoke-pdfpenpro-ocr, despite it's name, should work
#    correctly with PDFPen already.
#
#  USAGE
#  =====
#  
#   $1 . . . pdf to ocr
